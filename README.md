# Smart-Kart-functions-and-data
Some functions and data from my project using mario kart 64 ann

Those are functions that works as classes in OOP, and some data from mario kart 64 registers in RAM. It's a Lua code and it was
made to work with bizhawk 1.12.2 as a plugin. 
You can also find the mapping system through the game ram for the Neural Network inputs.
This project was inspired by mega ia x and mari/o.
Hopefully you might find that useful

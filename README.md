# Smart-Kart-functions-and-data
Some functions and data from my project using mario kart 64 ann

Those are functions that works as classes in OOP, and some data from mario kart 64 registers in RAM. It's a Lua code and it was
made to work with bizhawk 1.12.2 as a plugin. 
You can also find the mapping system through the game ram for the Neural Network inputs.
This project was inspired by mega ia x and mari/o.
Hopefully you might find that useful.
You can find some videos of it running here:

How it looks:

As you'll see in the docs, there's some problems with the mapping system

for example this one in Choco mountain, that will map to the neural network input even the track section above the kart, or the track below when the kart reach the high section, it's explained in the docs how to solve it.

todo: some tracks aren't playable because of some sections that uses a type of texture that the load track doesn't work, the texture map can be found at the end of the tweanns functions.lua functions file. Maybe some time I'll take a look on it, I think its because of the type of mainmemoryread function being used at the moment, but couldn't be as well:

FIXED: It can be mapped with 0x0A value on stage.ground_type, so this track is playable (it will map all the dark brown sand) :)

The whole project was only possible by RenaKunisaki and Shygoo reverse engineering Mario Kart 64, RenaKunisaki repository is at my favorites and you should definitely take a look if you want to work with mario kart 64 or even to understand  F3DEX, The RSP microcode program used by this game to render graphics.

The latest version can be found here:

Where you can see the snow and the bridge being mapped at the same time. It works on Koopa Troopa Beach as well or any
other texture (Actually the boosters in Dk jungle parkway and Royal Raceway are the only texture I tested and it didnt work).

What am I doing? Currently I'am training a new model to drive while mapping tracks like bowser castle and possible objects in the future (like cars and trucks in toad's turnpike).

**At the end of our journey, all we find was a hollow, meaningless future. Kain√© san, you've been gone for a really long time...**
